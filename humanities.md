The tectonic processes that shape the Earth operate on such long timescales and at such enormous spatial scales that it is difficult for us as individual humans to situate them in our own decadal lifespans. In this way, they share a strong affinity with mythology, the stories humans construct in order to make sense of a place and existence that is beyond our everyday comprehension. By studying these processes and figuring out how our dynamic planet came to be, we follow in the footsteps of those who told of gods and other legendary beings creating order out of chaos. In doing so, we continue the very human task of figuring out how to understand our history as a species in the context of a much longer broader history.
