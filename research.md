    title: "Tectonic Evolution of the Greater Caucasus"
    excerpt: "The Greater Caucasus Mountains lie on the northernmost margin of the active Arabia-Eurasia continental collision and contain the highest peaks of Europe. My work aims to understand why collisional deformation is localized in the Greater Caucasus, how the evolution and closure of the relict back-arc Caucasus Basin has influenced orogenesis, and how studying active collision in the Caucasus today can guide our understanding of ancient collisions.

    title: "Tectonic Geochemistry of Magmatic Rocks"
    excerpt: "Geochemistry provides a powerful means of the petrogenesis of igneous rocks and linking their formation to tectonic setting. Unfortunately, there is rarely a unique tectonic setting corresponding to a particular geochemical signature, which can lead to uncritical use of existing geochemical frameworks (i.e., tectonic discrimination diagrams) or wholesale rejection of the ability to use geochemistry to assess tectonics. My research aims to take advantage of modern data science and data availability to provide a more nuanced approach to linking geochemical data with other observational data and modeling studies in order to better understand tectonic processes.
